# App

This is a sample app demonstrating how to initiate ID card authentication using the [Web eID](https://github.com/web-eid/web-eid.js) javascript library.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have [Bun](https://bun.com) on your machine.

## To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix`

Now you can visit [`https://localhost:4001`](https://localhost:4001) from your browser.
> Note: HTTPS is required to communicate with the Web eID browser extension
