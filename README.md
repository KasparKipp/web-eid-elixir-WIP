# App

This is a sample app demonstrating how to initiate ID card authentication using the [Web eID](https://github.com/web-eid/web-eid.js) javascript library.

# Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure your computer is properly set up to use your ID card electronically.  
Follow the official guide: [You wish to start using your ID-card electronically](https://www.id.ee/en/article/you-wish-to-start-using-your-id-card-electronically/).


## Prerequisites


Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Elixir & Erlang](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [Bun](https://bun.com)

## To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix`

Now you can visit [`https://localhost:4001`](https://localhost:4001) from your browser.
